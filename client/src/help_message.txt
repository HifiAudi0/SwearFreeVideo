Hi,

This issue should fall under Basic/1 hour at $28.52.

I have a bug in Javascript. However, the project requires Node/Express/React/Python to work. The amount of code in those languages is however tiny and very basic. I am a new developer.

I am using YouTube iframe API. The bug won't let me call player.mute() at a certain point in the code. It does work in other parts of the code. 

I can always console.log player as a valid object even where I get the "error: player.mute is not a function."

I have been stuck on it for days however a more experienced developer may be able to solve it under 15 mins if its not a complicated fix.

I thought YouTube API was just broken, however, when viewing their demo sample they are able to achieve exactly what I want to accomplish and therefore it is more likely my in-experience as a developer ,that's the problem.

If your comfortable taking on the task please respond, I'll share the Github Repo link and we can get started? Thanks!
